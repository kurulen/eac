This is the Etterna Addon Compendium.

It is hosted at https://kurulen.github.io/eac.
It contains vital information on creating addons for Etterna, a
	vertically-scrolling rhythm game designed for keyboard use.

You can help contribute as well.
To get started, fork the repository and edit the files in the "src" directory.
GitHub Actions will automatically generate HTML from the markdown you have
	written, so don't worry too much about markup.
Once finished, submit a pull request and make changes as required.
