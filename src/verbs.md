# Verbs
---

Verbs, in games that use StepMania's engine (Etterna included), can be used to
	assist with scaling (for images), looping (for music and sounds), among
	other things.

To use a verb, place it **just before** the file's extension.
For example, to make an image `(doubleres)`, place `(doubleres)`
	before ".png", ".jpg", or other extension that the image may have.
